## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/withtimesgo1115/SocialNetworkFinalProject/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files. The Three Kingdoms period started with the end of the Han dynasty and was followed by the Jin dynasty. 

### Markdown

In China, the most famous, popular, and wonderful historical stories took place in the Three Kingdoms period, which was the tripartite division of China among the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu from 220-280AD. Luo Guanzhong, a great writer of the Ming Dynasty in China, created a wonderful historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms based on the historical stories of the Three Kingdoms period. This work was later honored as one of the Four Masterpieces of China. On the other hand, due to the great attraction of these heroes and stories, nearly all the people from East Asian countries like Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, etc. are fascinated by it. This can be verified easily that there are many video games with the Three Kingdoms topic issued from Japan or South Korea. The cultural symbol Three Kingdoms has become the common language of East Asian cultural circles. Actually, if you want to understand or know deeper about Chinese or East Asian culture, you should learn from the Three Kingdoms, which is very similar to the truth that Marvel Heros reflects the essence of American culture in a way.
